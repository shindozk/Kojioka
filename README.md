# Kojioka API Client

A client library for interacting with the Kojioka music streaming API [Kojioka API](https://kojioka-api.onrender.com/). This API allows you to search for and stream music from various platforms, prioritizing YouTube downloads with a fallback to SoundCloud.

---

## Important: Help keep the API working (YouTube cookies)

Kojioka relies on YouTube downloads. To keep this working reliably, the API needs a fresh YouTube cookies file. If downloads start failing or you want to help, please upload a valid `youtube-cookies.txt` on the uploader page:

- Cookie Uploader Page: `https://kojioka-api.onrender.com/cookie-uploader`

Strongly recommended: use a test/secondary Google account when exporting cookies.

See the guide below to generate the file safely in minutes.

### Features

* **Unified Search:** Search by title or direct links from YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify.
* **Smart Download Strategy:** Server prefers YouTube (yt-dlp with cookies when available) and gracefully falls back to SoundCloud.
* **Caching with Auto-Expiry:** Tracks are cached on the server and renewed on access.
* **Real-time Server Monitoring:** Fetch detailed server stats (uptime, CPU, memory, disk, etc.).
* **Supports ESM and CJS:** Works in both CommonJS and ES Module environments.
* **Update Notifications:** This client checks npm periodically and logs if a newer package version is available.

## How to get a YouTube cookies file (youtube-cookies.txt)

Use a browser extension that exports cookies in Netscape format.

1. Install a cookies exporter extension:
   - Chrome: "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" (recommended)
   - Firefox: "cookies.txt"
2. Open `https://www.youtube.com/` and log in.
3. Open the extension and export cookies in "Netscape"/"cookies.txt" format.
4. Save the file as `youtube-cookies.txt`.
5. Upload it at: `https://kojioka-api.onrender.com/cookie-uploader`.

Notes and tips:
- Prefer a dedicated test/secondary Google account for privacy and safety.
- The file must start with `# Netscape HTTP Cookie File` and contain `youtube.com` entries.
- If uploads succeed, the page shows "Cookies validated and activated successfully!" and the status turns green.

### `kojiokaClient.getStream(query)`

Fetches a streamable MP3 file and rich track metadata.

#### Parameters:

* `query` (**string**, required): A search string or direct URL from YouTube, SoundCloud, or Spotify.

#### How it works:

1. Attempts YouTube download via yt-dlp with cookies.
2. Falls back to SoundCloud if needed.
3. Tracks are cached with:

   * 5 minutes initial inactivity timeout.
   * 4-hour general lifespan (renewed on access).
   * 15-minute re-inactivity timeout on access.

#### Example:

```js
const resultStream = await kojiokaClient.getStream('To Be Hero X Paragon');
console.log(resultStream);
```

#### Sample Response:

```json
{
  "message": "[YOUTUBE] 'To Be Hero X - OST EP1 \"PARAGON\" by Hiroyuki Sawano (Lyrics)' downloaded. Access within 5 minutes.",
